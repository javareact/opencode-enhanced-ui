# OpenCode Enhanced UI


**An enhanced VS Code extension that brings OpenCode sessions into your editor with powerful organization, visual customization, and workflow tools. Based on [opencode-vscode-ui](https://github.com/a710128/opencode-vscode-ui.git) by [@a710128](https://github.com/a710128)**

> **Built for productive AI-assisted development:** browse sessions with a **workspace-aware sidebar**, customize your **panel themes**, track **subagents and todos**, organize with **tags and search**, and keep everything visible while you code—whether you work locally or over **Remote SSH**.

Stay in the editor, keep context intact, and manage OpenCode where the code already lives.

## Visual tour 👀

### Sessions sidebar with search and tags

The sidebar gives you a workspace-first view of your OpenCode sessions. Create, reopen, refresh, open the matching web UI, tag, filter, and search conversations without leaving VS Code.

Search sessions within one workspace at a time, or filter by tags to organize your active work.

### Panel theme system

Choose from three visual presets and optional accent color schemes to match your workflow preference. All themes and color schemes automatically adapt to VS Code's light or dark mode.

| Classic Theme | Codex Theme | Claude Theme |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Classic theme](docs/screenshots/theme-default.png) | ![Codex theme](docs/screenshots/theme-codex.png) | ![Claude theme](docs/screenshots/theme-claude.png) |
| Standard OpenCode styling | Tool-like preset with stronger framing | Softer preset with gentler surfaces |

Use `/theme` in a session panel to switch both presets and color schemes. The footer `Context` entrypoint is available across themes, so you can inspect session usage and raw message data without leaving the current tab.

### Dedicated conversation tabs

Each session opens in its own tab, making it easier to keep multiple threads organized while you continue editing code in the same window.

### Subagents companion view

Track subagent sessions spawned by the focused session in a dedicated sidebar panel. Monitor their status and navigate between parent and child sessions effortlessly.

### Enhanced todo and modified files views

Companion views help you triage focused-session tasks with grouped sections and filters, and inspect which files changed during the conversation.

| Enhanced Todo View | Modified Files Tracking |

### Compact skill invocations

Skill usage is rendered as clean, compact markers that don't clutter your transcript while still providing full visibility into what skills are being used.

### Session view in secondary sidebar

Open the dedicated session view in VS Code's secondary sidebar for a focused conversation experience alongside your primary sidebar.

## Remote SSH ready 🌐

OpenCode Enhanced UI runs on the correct extension host, so Remote SSH sessions stay aligned with the active workspace.

- Runs against the remote machine when you use Remote SSH
- Preserves workspace identity across local and remote folders
- Keeps file opening and panel restore behavior aligned with the active workspace
- All enhanced features work seamlessly over SSH

## Requirements

- **VS Code `1.94.0` or newer**
- **`opencode` installed on the active extension host and available on `PATH`**
  - If `opencode` lives outside `PATH`, set the `opencode-ui.opencodePath` setting to its absolute path. Editor restart required.

If you use Remote SSH, **install `opencode` on the remote host** so the extension can launch `opencode serve` there.

## Quick start ⚡

1. Open a project folder in VS Code.
2. Confirm `opencode` is available in that environment.
3. Open the OpenCode view from the Activity Bar.
4. Run `OpenCode: Check Environment` if you want to verify setup first.
5. Create a new session or reopen one from the sidebar.
6. Right-click an editor selection or current file to open OpenCode with prefilled context.
7. Right-click selected files in the Explorer to seed a new session with multiple file refs.
8. Use the always-visible OpenCode status bar entry to reopen the active session or start a quick session from the current editor.
9. Customize your experience in settings: choose a panel theme, configure diff rendering, and adjust visibility options.

## Tips & Tricks 💡

- **Use tags to organize sessions** - Right-click any session and choose "Manage Session Tags" to add custom tags, then filter by tag to focus on specific work
- **Try different panel themes** - Switch between classic, codex, and claude presets, then tune the palette with default, nocturne, orchid, verdant, solar, graphite, or ember
- **Open the Context panel when you need details** - Use the footer `Context` entrypoint to inspect session usage, provider/model details, and raw message payloads without leaving the current tab
- **Monitor subagents** - Keep the Subagents view open to track child sessions spawned during complex tasks
- **Quick context actions** - Select code and right-click to instantly ask OpenCode about it
- **Search within workspaces** - Use the search icon on workspace rows to quickly find sessions without affecting other workspaces
- **Open the web UI when you need it** - Use the globe icon on a workspace row to jump straight to that workspace's opencode web interface
- **Use the status bar** - Click the OpenCode status bar item for quick access to the active session

## Notes

- **Sessions are organized per workspace folder**
- **Remote SSH requires `opencode` on the remote host**
- **Environment issues can be checked** with `OpenCode: Check Environment`
- **Panel themes adapt to VS Code's light/dark mode automatically**
- **Session tags are stored locally and workspace-specific**
